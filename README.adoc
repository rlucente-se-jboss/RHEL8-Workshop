= RHEL8-Workshop

Foundational exercises to introduce core concepts of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8

= Before you begin

1.  Install git and ansible (enable the ansible-2-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms repo)
2.  Ensure you can ssh to root@localhost using an ssh key
    
    ssh-keygen 
    
    ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub root@localhost
    
    ssh root@localhost
    
3.  Run the playbook to setup the lab

    cd ~/RHEL8-Workshop
    
    bash prepare-rhel8-workshop.sh 

Once the script is done, root and student users will be created with the password of "r3dh4t".
